    <blockquote>Coronary angiography is a procedure that uses dye and special X-Rays to visualize the coronary arteries. The coronary arteries are the blood vessels that supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscles. Coronary angiography is carried out to determine whether any significant narrowing is present in the coronary arteries, and what the best form of treatment is.</blockquote>
    <br>
    <blockquote>On ordinary chest X-Ray films, the heart appears as a silhouette and the coronary arteries cannot be seen. To see the coronary arteries, a special dye or contrast medium is injected through a small tube (catheter) inserted via an artery in the groin or at the wrist. The catheter is then advanced to the heart and positioned at the openings of the coronary arteries before the injection  of the dye is performed.</blockquote>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>BENEFITS :</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Show anycoronary arteries that are blocked or narrowed by fatty plaques (atherosclerosis)</li>
        <li>Pinpoint where blockages are located in patient’s heartand blood vessels</li>
        <li>Show how much blood flow is blocked through the blood vessels</li>
        <li>Check the results of previous coronary bypass surgery</li>
    </ul>
<b>Your doctor may recommend coronary angiography if you have :</b>
<ul>
    <li>Angina (unexplained pain or pressure in your chest)</li>
    <li>Survived a Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA)</li>
    <li>Abnormal resultsfrom tests such as anElectrocardiogram (ECG), exercise stress test, or other test</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>WHAT TO EXPECT</b>
<blockquote>The procedure may be performed on an outpatient basis, or you may be admitted overnight. Some routine investigations, including blood tests, an Electrocardiogram (ECG) and a chest X-Ray may be done before the procedure. You will normally fast for 6-8 hours before the procedure. After the catheter placement and filming, which normally takes about 15-30 minutes, the catheters will be removed. The procedure will terminate and the sheath removed from your wrist and groin. Your puncture site will be compressed for 10 to 15 minutes until bleeding stops, after which compressive bandage will be applied. You would need to lie flat on your back for 4 to 6 hours. You can usually be discharged either the same evening or early the next day.</blockquote>
